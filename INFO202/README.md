# Projects
In this paper created an Information system for a technology retailer. The information system is an web-based online store. We created the online store using two different approaches, [server-side rendering](https://github.com/putto11262002/uni-projects/tree/master/INFO202/server-side-rendering) and [client-side rendering](https://github.com/putto11262002/uni-projects/tree/master/INFO202/client-side-rendering).
