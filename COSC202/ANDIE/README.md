# Development process.
This project was developed ba team of four students including myself. We used GitLab for our Version Control 
Software and Microsoft Teams for collaboration. We have meetings that the beginning of each week to discuss features and bugs and allocate task to each team membeers. It took us approximately two months to deliver the software, with each team member spending around 5 hours per week on the project.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
